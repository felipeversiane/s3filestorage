# File Manager API
API responsible for creating and managing files.

## Introduction

The API itself is for study purposes, and aims to be a simple API for crud and file management, using Docker and a AWS S3 service.

## 🛠 Main libraries used

- **pgxpool** - A package from the pgx library, pgxpool provides a connection pool for PostgreSQL databases. It allows efficient management of database connections and helps in handling multiple concurrent requests to the database with reduced latency and resource consumption.

- **github.com/google/uuid** - This library provides utilities for generating and working with UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers). It supports the creation of various types of UUIDs, including UUIDv1, UUIDv4, and UUIDv5, and is used to ensure unique identifiers in distributed systems and databases.

- **github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go** - This is a Go client library for interacting with AWS services, including S3, EC2, Lambda, and more. It provides a convenient and efficient way for Go applications to communicate with AWS resources by offering APIs for managing cloud services, storage, computing, and other AWS features.
